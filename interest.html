            <h1><emphasize>&gt;</emphasize> Interest in IT</h1>

            <h2>Start of interest</h2>
            <p>My interest in the Information Technology field first sparked when I discovered PCs at the age of 12 years old. I got introduced to the custom PC world by this well-known youtuber called “Linus Tech Tips”. I am especially obsessed with the fact that are a million parts available in the market that you could utilize to finalize your own unique PC build, in my opinion it adds more depth to your PC build. Nowadays, I like to daydream and fantasize about owning all the expensive GPUs in the market. Looking at you RTX 3090!</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Recently, around 2 years ago I also got introduced to programming by my teacher at my High School (Bayside College). In my opinion, everyone should learn at least one programming language as it teaches you a framework of problem-solving, improves your reasoning skills and refines your attention to detail. The first programming language that I ever learnt was Python. When first learning to code in python I was taught in combination by my High School Software Design Teacher and W3schools. </p>
            
            <p>Since, then I have also been obsessed with Code Wars and some Leet Code and completing coding questions that challenge my perspective of what’s possible with code. However, most recently, I have been exploring more practical use cases of programming, and therefore have gained some experience in writing backend-code with Python using the Flask framework and using HTML/CSS as my frontend. I have also created other programming projects to solve problems that I faced in real-life. One of these problems I faced, was remembering quotes for my final English Exam in Year 12. To negate this problem, I created an SQLite Database that stores all the important quotes from all novels we read. I then utilized Python to make an automated bot that sends 2 random quotes to my Email every-day. This allowed me to learn important quotes one day at a time, instead of cramming all in one day, and to be honest I had fun coding the whole project so that was a big plus for me.</p>
            <h2>Studying at RMIT</h2>
            <p>I have Chosen to study at RMIT University because it is a reputable University when it comes to courses that relate to Technology. RMIT also takes a more hands-on approach, meaning the courses are more focused on developing skills that will help you better integrate into the working environment of your industry. Lastly, the location is also perfect, as RMIT stands in the heart of Melbourne CBD and is easily accessible by public transport, which improves my quality of life on campus as I never have to worry too much about exchanging multiple busses and trains to get on campus.</p>

            <h2>Learning Expectations</h2>
            <p>As I am particularly eager about moving forward into the software development world, I expect to learn and develop skills that will help me reach my dream job of becoming a software developer. Therefore, I expect to learn about the tools Software Developers need and the processes they must go through to become a successful developer. I am also interested in Web-design and want to learn how to make a beautiful frontend UI with HTML/CSS. But also want to learn about the Backend and want to go in-depth about how background processes and managed within a Web-framework.</p>
