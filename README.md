# Harshnoor-Assignment-1-IT-MyProfile
 Hi my name is Harshnoor Singh.
 Currently I am studying Information Technology at RMIT University.
 This project was made as my very first assignment in the First year of my course.
 It demonstrates why I chose to study in the field of Information Technology, at RMIT University and what my passion in the IT field looks like.
 It also demonstrates my future ambitions and what I would like to make of myself in the future.
 I hope you enjoy yourself browsing through my little project.
